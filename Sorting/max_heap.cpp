/*
A max heap and min heap are types of priority queues, where the elements are organized in a way that the 
largest (or smallest) element is at the root of the heap, and the elements are ordered in a way that the parent node 
is either greater than (or less than) its child nodes. The main difference between a max heap and a min heap is the direction 
of the ordering, with a max heap having the largest element at the root and a min heap having the smallest element at the root.


Purpose and Use Cases of Max-Heap:

Priority Queue: One of the primary uses of the heap data structure is for implementing priority queues. 

Heap Sort: The heap data structure is also used in sorting algorithms.  

Memory Management: The heap data structure is also used in memory management. When a program needs to allocate memory dynamically, 
it uses the heap data structure to keep track of the available memory. 

Graph Algorithms: The heap data structure is used in various graph algorithms. 
For example, Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm uses a heap data structure to keep track of the vertices with the 
shortest path from the source vertex.

    If you need to find the left and right node of the node then
    e.g if the node is at ith index then 
    left Node can be found at (2 * i) th index
    right Node can be found at  (2 * i ) + 1 th index
